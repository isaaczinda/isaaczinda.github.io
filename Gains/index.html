				<h3>Lift small weights</h3>
				<p>If you lift weight over three pounds, it's really bad for your gainz. If will make your muscles small because the excessive fatigue will make them weak. Real men lift small weight. Only arrogant douchebags who don't know shit about gains care how much they can bench.</p>
				<p>The most effective weights for weight training:</p>

				

				<h3>Do Steriods</h3>
				<p>Science has shown us that steriods are the real way to get gainz. Through athletic achievers like lance armstrong and every weight lifter ever, steriods have shown great success. Steriiods remain the most proven time-tested method for getting swole. Recent studies have shown that they also aren't bad for you at all! A herione addict named frank once told me, "yo...man...hittin them roids is like safer than shooring up." Since anyone with a first grade education knows that doing herione is completely risk free, frank proves that roids are even safer than that!</p>
