      <h1>I am a computer science major at Harvey Mudd College interested in backend development and data science.</h1>

    <p>I have created this website to demonstrate my passion for computer science and to provide a showcase for my resume. As a freshman at Harvey Mudd College this year, I plan to major in computer science and applied math. I have worked with a wide range of tools in many different professional settings. I have interned at Microsoft Research and worked in the University of Washington Ubiquitous Computing Lab.  I have designed a neural network from scratch, helped build a high-altitude wind model, worked on the Linux kernel, and developed numerous websites. Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions about my work.</p>
