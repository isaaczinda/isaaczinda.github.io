This website was created to demonstrate my passion for web design and programming and to provide a showcase for my resume. To explore my resume, simply visit the tab at the top of the page. Installers for desktop projects can be found on the downloads page. The robotics tab outlines my experience with the First Tech Challenge by way of my team's engineering notebook. Some sites I have created are located under the web projects tab.
