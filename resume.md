**Goals and Interests**

I am a motivated and well-rounded student with a keen interest in computer science. My position as the robotics team captain, my work on the "Mainstream" water sculpture, and my work at the UW demonstrate my passion for technology. Ultimate Frisbee, piano, and computer-related volunteering highlight my wide range of interests.

I expect to study computer science or applied math in college. After I graduate, I would like to attend graduate school or work for a technology startup. I enjoy tackling difficult and interesting problems with the aid of technology and hope to find a job where I can work on these kinds of challenges.
