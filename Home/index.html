						<h1 class = "">Centipede</h1>
						I created <em>Centipede</em> in a two week Digipen programming class. It is a clone of the popular 80's game made for the Atari, but features a two-player mode and different monsters. It can also be played with Xbox controllers. To <em>Centipede</em>, first you have to download and <a href = "http://isaaczinda.com/Downloads/SlimDX.msi">install SlimDX</a>, and then you have to download and  <a href = "http://isaaczinda.com/Downloads/Centipede_Installer.exe">install the game.</a>
					</div>
					<div class = "col-sm-12 col-md-6">
						<h1 class = "">Renderer</h1>
						I created <em>Renderer</em> from the ground up, as an expiriment to see if I could build a basic 3D engine. The program draws in wireframe, supports world rotation, scaling, and translation, and draws from an STL file. <em>Renderer</em> was build with the 2D Tkinter canvas and uses hardware accceleration for matrix multiplications, but all of the rendering and geometry is done by my engine. Click here to download a demo of the engine: <a href = "http://isaaczinda.com/Downloads/Install_Renderer.exe">Install Renderer</a>
