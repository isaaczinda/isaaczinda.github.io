# First Tech Challenge Description

The First Tech Challenge, or FTC, is a nationwide robotics competition. High-school students are given three months and an almost unlimited list of materials to construct a robot which fits in an 18 inch cube and plays a specific game. A video describing this year's game can be seen [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABmBxCwHV94, "First Tech Challenge video"). Robots successful in their regionals' competitions will advance to state, Super Regionals, and then worlds. Individuals as well as teams can receive awards. Students who have demonstrated technical expertise, commitment to the FIRST community, and the ability to lead teammates can be selected as a Dean's list semi-finalist, finalist, or winner. FTC has become a passion of mine due to its fun yet difficult challenges great community.

### Awards

I was a National Dean's List finalist in 2015. A Dean's List winner demonstrates technical expertise, commitment to the FIRST community, and the ability to lead teammates. My school's writeup about this award is linked [here](http://www.seattleacademy.info/wp/robotics-competes-at-superregional-zinda-%E2%80%9916-named-to-ftc-dean%E2%80%99s-list-finalist/ "Dean's list article")

My team placed second in the 2015 state competition, which qualified us for Super Regionals where we competed against entire west coast.

My team won the second place Inspire Award at the state competition 2015. "The team that receives this award is chosen by the judges as having best represented a role model FIRST Tech Challenge Team.

### Contributions

To allow for precise turning and movement, my mentor, Gabe Cronin, and I built an IMU and wrote protocols which allow it to communicate with the NXT brick. The Gyroscope, Accelerometer, and Magnetometer data are incorporated using a Kalman filter and sent to the NXT using the I2C industry standard.
	
I built our team's telescoping arm which uses drawer slides to lift balls high into the air and deploy them in tall tubes.

Teammates and I collaborated to build our robot's ball collector, which collects the balls which are then scored into tubes.

I wrote all the code for my team's robot, all of which is stored in [our repository](https://github.com/redshiftrobotics/2856 "team Github repository") on Github.

# 2015 / 16 Season

We were a finalist at Regionals and won the Inspire Award. The season is still in progress.
