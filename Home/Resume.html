								I am a motivated, well-rounded student who excels at public speaking, programming and athletics. Sports and robotics have given me experience working in groups, while independent programming projects have given me the initiative to see projects to completion. You can learn more about me at isaaczinda.com.
								I'm looking for an opportunity to get real-world work experience as a software developer this summer. My interests include server-side development, embedded systems, robotics, and web design, but I am eager to do any kind of programming work. My schedule is flexible and I am open to work as part of a team or on my own, whatever your company requires.
