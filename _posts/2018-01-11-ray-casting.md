title: Rendering Engine Using Ray Casting  
category: projects
---

Program allows user to import objects from STL files and specify different properties (color, shininess, reflection intensity). You can setup any number of point lights to illuminate these objects. I used the [Phong Reflection Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phong_reflection_model) to make the lighting realistic, and have also included shadows. Below is a scene that I rendered with the engine:
