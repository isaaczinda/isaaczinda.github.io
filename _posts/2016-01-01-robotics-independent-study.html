  <p>Model of our robot, created in SolidWorks.</p>

<p>Worked with a friend to create a robot capable of climbing vertical glass walls using pneumatic suction cups. The robot is controlled using an Arduino, and designed entirely in SolidWorks. Custom laser cut and 3D printed parts were used as an alternative to metal components to reduce the robot's weight.</p>
