title: Centipede
---

I created Centipede in a two week Digipen programming class. It is a clone of the popular 80's game made by Atari, but features a two-player mode and different monsters. It can also be played with Xbox controllers. To play Centipede, first you have to download and [install SlimDX](http://isaaczinda.com/Downloads/SlimDX.msi "install SlimDX"), and then you have to download and [install the game](http://isaaczinda.com/Downloads/Centipede_Installer.exe "install the game"). To start a new game, use the arrow keys to select single player and hit enter. To play, use the left and right arrow keys to move and the up arrow to fire. Press escape to pause the game.
