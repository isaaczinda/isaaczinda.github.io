title: mcp9808 Temperature Sensor Library
---

mcp9808 is an open-source library written in Node.js and published to Node Package Manager. The package makes it easy to communicate the mcp9808 temperature sensor from a raspberry pi computer using the I2C industry standard protocol. My package can be found online [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mcp9808 "link to package").
