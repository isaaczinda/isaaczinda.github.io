title: Python 3D Renderer
---

I created Renderer from the ground up, as an experiment to see if I could build a basic 3D engine. The program draws in wireframe, supports world rotation, scaling, and translation, and draws from an STL file. Renderer was build with the 2D Tkinter canvas and uses hardware acceleration for matrix multiplications, but all of the rendering and geometry is done by my engine. Click here to download a demo of the engine: [install renderer](http://isaaczinda.com/Downloads/Install_Renderer.exe "install Renderer").
